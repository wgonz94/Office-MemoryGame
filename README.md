## What does The Office Clicky Game Do?

* It renders different cast members from the Office to the screen. Each image should listen for click events. 
* It keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time
* The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart
* if the User picks all 16 images/cards without picking the same one twice, it is counted as a win.
